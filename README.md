# AI-Based Solar Energy Forecasting System

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning-based system to forecast short-term solar power generation (15-minute ahead) using historical plant generation and weather sensor data.

The system integrates preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and deployment through a web-based interface built using Streamlit.

The final solution allows users to upload raw plant data and receive:

* 15-minute ahead power forecasts
* Performance evaluation metrics
* Visual trend analysis
* Hourly seasonal behavior insights

## 2. Problem Statement

Solar energy generation is inherently variable due to:

•⁠  ⁠Cloud cover fluctuations
•⁠  ⁠Temperature variation
•⁠  ⁠Irradiance instability
•⁠  ⁠Diurnal and seasonal cycles

Grid operators require short-term forecasting to:

•⁠  ⁠Maintain grid stability
•⁠  ⁠Optimize battery storage
•⁠  ⁠Balance demand and supply
•⁠  ⁠Reduce reliance on fossil fuel backups

The core problem is:

- ⁠Given historical inverter-level solar generation data and environmental conditions, predict the plant-level DC power output 15 minutes into the future.

Key challenges:

•⁠  ⁠Strong time-dependency in power output
•⁠  ⁠Nonlinear relationships between weather and generation
•⁠  ⁠High variance during sunrise and sunset transitions
•⁠  ⁠Noise in inverter-level measurements

This system addresses the problem as a supervised regression task with temporal feature engineering.
